# Solving real-world problems in Jupyter Notebook by using NYC Open Data API

## Resources Used
* NYC Open Data API : A public API provided by the city of New York that offers access to various datasets.
* Jupyter Notebook
* Pandas Python Library

Used Jupyter Notebook and a python library called Pandas to easily manipulate the data in the dataset. 

### Day 1-
Pre-processed the data. This step included cleaning the data, handling missing values, and analyzing the data for further analysis.

### Day 2-
After the pre-processing step is the EDA step (Exploratory Data Analysis). This is where we find main characteristics and patterns in the datset. And after that is the data visualization step where we visualized the data and created charts, graphs, and heatmaps that help lead to finding solutions for the real-world problem.
